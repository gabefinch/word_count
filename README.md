This is a simple Sinatra web app that takes a word and some text in a form page
and displays the number of times the word was found in the results page. It was completed at the end of the frst week of Epicodus. The underlying method will find matches within words e.g. it will find and
count "cat" in "cathedral". This is accomplished in very few lines of code using the string split method.

To setup, run bundler in the project directory, then run the app.rb file with
Ruby.  
```
$ ruby app.rb
```
The form then be found on `localhost:4567/form`. Enjoy!
